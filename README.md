# Release Notes

This Open Government Platform was developed and launched in January 2014. The development of the platform, visualizations and dashboards was conducted by multiple development firms based in the United States and in the Philippines. This Open Government Platform ("white-label version") is being released via GitHub under an Open Source initiative to assist other countries and providers to advance the discussion in building the practice of Open Data. 

The Open Government Platform while sufficiently advanced in terms of programming and design in 2013 the pace of technology is rapid and there are numerous updates and fixes available for this platform. To this end there are many opportunities to further develop the platform with functional and aesthetic enhancements. 

That said, the initiative abides by the aphorism "Perfect is the enemy of good", and the code is released with the hope that it is a good (not perfect) starting point for others to learn from and improve in their Open Data initiatives as well as to contribute back to this repository so that the greater community can continue to benefit. 

# Site Audit

Prior to release a site audit was perfromed in December 2015 by a third-party to assess the structure, issues and recommendations for future development. It is available within the repo and a direct link: https://github.com/opengovt/open-government-platform/blob/master/2015-12-05-Open-Govt-Platfom-Site-Audit.pdf

We strongly encourage that these recommendations be followed for all who would use this platform.
