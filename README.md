# Release Notes

The initial development of this platform was in Jaunary 2013. Development was likewise done by multiple development firms and is now being released as an open source initiative to help other countries or providers looking to build Open Data initiatives throughout the world. As technology continues to move at a rapid release pace, there are numerous updates and fixes available for this platform. Further, hindsight is perfect and looking back now, nearly 3 years from the initial development there are countless improvements that we would now make to this project. These changes, some within our own work and some within the other developer's work, would be beneficial and would improve this platform. That said, we abide by the aphorism "Perfect is the enemy of good", and we release this with the hope that it is a good (not perfect) starting point for others to learn from and improve in their Open Data initiatives as well as to contribute back to this repository so that the greater community can continue to benefit.

# Site Audit

Prior to release a site audit was perfromed in December 2015 by a third-party to assess the structure, issues and recommendations for future development. It is available within the repo and a direct link: https://github.com/opengovt/open-government-platform/blob/master/2015-12-05-Open-Govt-Platfom-Site-Audit.pdf

We strongly encourage that these recommendations be followed for all who would use this platform.
